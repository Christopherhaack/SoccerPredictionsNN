I actually like all of these guys posts http://colah.github.io/ good reads.

more datasets to potentially use
https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata game results for many leagues spanning back from 1888 downsides not much detail in data. (might be good to see how a barebones prediction does relative to more advanced stuff with more features), i.e. how much does a teams previous results (just win/tie/loss and goals scored against) factor into future success.
http://www.footytube.com/openfooty/ Most detailed sets including player quotes, but might not have as much data in terms of length of time. also its a live set. cant use this set under their liscensing agreement to do what i want.
